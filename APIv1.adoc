= Byteport HTTP APIv1

2015-09-30

== Disclaimer
The Byteport HTTP APIv2 is under development with many additional functions.
The v1 API described in this document will be supported until *2016-12-31*.

== Introduction
If you are not instructed otherwise, all calls should be made against the following
URL

https://api.byteport.se

While it may work to access www.byteport.se for the same purpose, it may not be
so in the future.

Whenever a GET-call is made, the client receives a cookie named csrftoken. This
token must be supplied in all calls made below as csrftoken. In addition, the
same token must be supplied as the form data parameter csrfmiddlewaretoken in
any POST calls made. The csrftoken is a Cross Site Request Forgery token and
is a security measure.

The client must then login correctly to obtain the sessionid cookie before any
other service calls can be made. A HTTP POST call is made in this step.

Note that the responses given by the server is shown with a yellow background.

To be able to login and use the data accessing APIs you must have met the
following prerequisites:

. Have a valid username and password to the Byteport instance you are accessing
. The user must have access to the namespace you are working against.
. Knowledge and understanding of the concepts namespace, device uid and
field name etc.

== Storing data using API-key method

This method does not require the client to login to obtain the sessionid but
instead you need to enable the namespace to accept writes by API-key using
either GET or POST methods, or both. See the namespace security-tab in the
Byteport instance (go here: https://www.byteport.se/manager/namespaces/, select
namespace and open up “Security”).

It is highly recommended to include a timestamp in each call as there is no
guarantee the data is immediately parsed and stored.

=== Store multiple data points for a device

[cols="h,5a"]
|===

| URL
| /api/v1/store/[namespace]/[device uid]/

| Method(s)
| POST

| Parameter(s)
|
_key::
 The namespace API key
_ts::
 UNIX Timestamp in seconds since epoch.
[any other]::
 Interpreted as data fields

| Response Body
| N/A

|===

=== Examples

==== Example 1
Storing a heartbeat using GET call, no data is supplied, that is supported:

 $ curl "http://api.byteport.se/api/v1/store/mySpace/10/?_key=1D3c2"

==== Example 2:
When supplying data, you may also supply a timestamp in seconds since UNIX epoch. All other parameters (GET or POST) will be interpreted as application data, values can be any common number format or a string:

 $ curl "http://api.byteport.se/api/v1/store/mySpace/10/?_key=1D3c2&_ts=1410613385.123&temp=20&last_word=mom"

== Log in
To access stored data from a client, the client will first need to log in to obtain the sessionid cookie. The flow
to complete a successful login vs. Byteport is as follows

. Obtain *csrftoken*
. Perform the actual login, include csrftoken as Cookie and set *username*, *password*, and *csrfmiddlewaretoken*
as POST parameters.
. Store the returned *sessionid* cookie for future API requests. Ignore the 302 redirects.

=== Obtain CSRFTOKEN
The first thing to to is to make a simple GET call vs the login URL to obtain the csrftoken cookie.

[cols="h,5a"]
|===

| URL
| /accounts/login/

| Method(s)
| GET

| Response Set-Cookie
| csrftoken

|===

=== Perform the actual login
Now supply the csrftoken as a cookie, as well as a request parameter in the POST call together with the username and password:

[cols="h,5a"]
|===

| URL
| /accounts/login/

| Method(s)
| POST

| Cookie
| csrftoken (*must* be supplied regardless of also being set as POST data)

| Parameter(s)
|
username::
password::
csrfmiddlewaretoken::
 The CrossSiteRequestForgery token obtained as a Set-cooke in the GET request earlier.

| Response Set-Cookie
| csrftoken, sessionid

| Response Body
| N/A

|===

The server will respond with a Set-Cooke called *sessionid* that must be
included in any subsequent call where the logged in context is needed.

Note that the server may respond with a 302 redirect that can be omitted

=== Get single data point as file
Using the *r* as obtained using the above timeseries range call, the details for a single data point can be downloaded
as a file. This is typically performed on data packets. If the packet was compressed and encoded it will be uncompressed
and unencoded before sent to the client by default. The same *r* is used as in the above load of single value.

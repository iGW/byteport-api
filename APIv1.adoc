== Notes on API version
The Byteport HTTP APIv2 is under development with many additional functions.
The v1 API described in this document will be supported at least until *2016-12-31*.

Changes to the API minor number will not break the API but is a hint to added functionality only
and will *not change* the URL prefix, ie v1.0 and v1.1 clients both uses the /api/v1/ prefix.

== Changelog
=== v1.6b [2017/01]
[BETA] - Added API for device registration.

=== v1.5b [2016/09]
[BETA] - Added initial websocket support for notifications of changes in device control data.

=== v1.4 [2016/03]
Added (experimental) method to analyze time series data to establish if an anomaly has occurred.

=== v1.3 [2016/02]
Added method to view last 24h namespace activity. Added method to obtain time series statistics.

=== v1.2 [2016/01]
Added method to POST messages to devices through API method via the message broker network.
A GET to the same URL will load message history.

=== v1.1 [2015/12]
Added mode to load namespace and device data using the new *depth* parameter. By adding depth
a device can also append its child devices in the same request.

=== v1.0 [2015/11]
First version, all essentials for loading Namespace, Device, Device Types and Time series data.

== Connecting and HTTP details
If you are not instructed otherwise, all calls should be made against the following
host:

https://api.byteport.se

While it may work to access www.byteport.se for the same purpose, it may not be
so in the future.

Whenever a GET-call is made, the client receives a cookie named csrftoken. This
token must be supplied in all calls made below as csrftoken. In addition, the
same token **must be supplied** as the form data parameter csrfmiddlewaretoken in
any POST calls made. The csrftoken is a Cross Site Request Forgery token and
is a security measure.

The client must then login correctly to obtain the sessionid cookie before any
other service calls can be made. A HTTP POST call is made in this step.

Also, note that the Referrer header also needs to be set in each call to the
API. This is sometimes handled by HTTP client libraries, and sometimes not or
need to be configured. Web browsers to this.

A last thing to be-ware of is to set the User-Agent header to a well-known one
such as curl/7.51.0.

To be able to login and use the data accessing APIs you must have met the
following prerequisites:

. Have a valid username and password to the Byteport instance you are accessing
. The user must have access to the namespace you are working against.
. Knowledge and understanding of the concepts namespace, device uid and
field name etc. For a brief primer on this subject, read below.


== Names
At the heart of Byteport are the time series data that are continuously stored from
your devices. All data are stored vs a unique key called a Byteport GUID. The key
is defined like this:

`*[Namespace name].[Device UID].[Field name]*`

Example, logging the speed of a mining cart uses this valid name

*megamine.cart-44.Speed1*

The names used in the Byteport GUID must all adhere to the following rules:

- Must be between 2 characters and 32 characters long.
- Can not contain other characters than: 0-9, a-z,A-Z, dash, underscore and colon.
- Can not start with dash (-) or underscore (_).

In addition, a namespace created by a user must be longer than 6 characters.


=== Reserved fields
Any field name starting with an underscore character (_) will not be stored as a data field.
Such fields are reserved meta fields to the Byteport data receiver. There are only two field
name in use for this purpose at the moment, but further functionality may be added:

|===
|Field name | Description

|_key
|The API key to the namespace.

|_ts
|A custom timestamp for all the data supplied in the call.
|===


The following fields are not meta fields, but pose a special function as they are interpreted as log messages and will
be displayed in various panels for the purpose, operations summary reports etc.
|===
|Field name |Description

|debug
|Log messages of DEBUG level. Stored on device level only.

|info
|Log messages of INFO level. Stored on device level only.

|warn
|Log messages of WARN level. Stored on device namespace level.

|error
|Log messages of ERROR level. Stored on device namespace level.
|===


== Storing data using API-key method

This method does not require the client to login to obtain the sessionid but
instead you need to enable the namespace to accept writes by API-keys.
See the namespace security-tab in the Byteport instance
(go here: https://www.byteport.se/manager/namespaces/, select namespace and
open up “Security”).

It is highly recommended to include a timestamp in each call as there is no
guarantee the data is immediately parsed and stored.

=== Store multiple data points for a device

[cols="h,5a"]
|===

| URL
| /api/v1/timeseries/[namespace]/[device uid]/

| Method
| POST, GET

| Parameter(s)
|
_key::
 The namespace API key
_ts::
 UNIX Timestamp in seconds since epoch.
[any other]::
 Interpreted as data fields

| Response Body
| N/A

|===

=== Examples

==== Example 1
Storing a heartbeat using curl, no data is supplied, that is supported:

 $ curl --data "_key=1D3c2" "http://api.byteport.se/api/v1/timeseries/mySpace/10/"

==== Example 2:
When supplying data, you may also supply a timestamp in seconds since UNIX epoch. All other parameters will be
interpreted as application data, values can be any common number format or a string:

 $ curl --data "_key=1D3c2&_ts=1410613385.123&temp=20&last_word=mom" "http://api.byteport.se/api/v1/timeseries/mySpace/10/"


== Log in
To access stored data from a client, the client will first need to log in to obtain the sessionid cookie. The flow
to complete a successful login vs. Byteport is as follows

. Obtain *csrftoken*
. Perform the actual login, include csrftoken as Cookie and set *username*, *password*, and *csrfmiddlewaretoken*
as POST parameters.
. Store the returned *sessionid* cookie for future API requests.

=== Obtain CSRFTOKEN
The first thing to to is to make a simple GET call vs the login URL to obtain the csrftoken cookie.

[cols="h,5a"]
|===

| URL
| /api/v1/login/

| Method
| GET

| Response Set-Cookie
| csrftoken

|===

=== Perform the actual login
Now supply the csrftoken as a cookie, as well as a request parameter in the POST call together with the username and password:

[cols="h,5a"]
|===

| URL
| /api/v1/login/

| Method
| POST

| Cookie
| csrftoken (*must* be supplied regardless of also being set as POST data)

| Parameter(s)
|
username::
password::
csrfmiddlewaretoken::
 The CrossSiteRequestForgery token obtained as a Set-cooke from an earlier GET request.

| Response Set-Cookie
| csrftoken, sessionid

| Response Body
| N/A

|===

The server will respond with a Set-Cooke called *sessionid* that must be
included in any subsequent call where the logged in context is needed.


== Log out
Log out by doing any kind of request to the log out URL. Server will respond with 200 OK upon successful logout. This
will invalidate your current sessionid, and you will need to obtain a new one by logging in again.

[cols="h,5a"]
|===

| URL
| /api/v1/logout/

| Method
| Any

| Response code
| 200


|===


== Echo
This method will echo back the supplied GET parameters as JSON data and does not require a logged in session.

=== Device Registration
Register one or several Device UIDs in a Namespace. The device_uid
parameter can take on one of the following forms:

theDevice::
A single device.

deviceA, deviceB, DeviceC::
Three devices from a comma separated list.

device100-107::
Eight devices devices in the span, each with prefix "device".

10-19::
Ten devices where the UID will be a single number.

100-107Dev::
Eight devices devices in the span, each with suffix "Dev".


[cols="h,5a"]
|===

| URL
| /api/v1/namespace/register_device/[namespace name]/

| Method
| POST

| Cookie
| csrftoken, sessionid

| Parameter(s)
| device_uid::
  A single valid Device UID or a valid range descriptor when settings batch_register to True. See the above description.
 device_type_id::
  A number specifying the ID of the device type to set this device to.
csrfmiddlewaretoken::
 The CrossSiteRequestForgery token obtained as a Set-cooke from an earlier GET request.
 batch_register::
  OPTIONAL: Set this to True when using the range specifier when registering multiple devices using the dash. Default i false.
 force::
  OPTIONAL: Registration will look like a successful new registration even if one or several devices already was existing. Default is false.
 active::
  OPTIONAL: Set to True if this device is considered to be an active in-use device right away. Default is false.
 reg_code::
  OPTIONAL: If a custom registration code is wanted. Only usable when registering a single device (ie. batch_register=False).
  The registration will fail if it is not globally unique.

| Content type
| application/json

| Notes
| In the examples below. Note how 'input_parameters' structure returned shows what parameters used when performing the call.

A list of some important properties will be returned for each device that was registered. The **access_key** property
is also the password in some instances when a Device is contacting Byteport.

If there is a problem registering the devices. There will be no **registration_result** and instead there will be an
**error** field describing the result.

When batch registering. There could be potential problems with registering certain UIDs, in that case, there will be
one or several entries of **errors** under the **registration_result** dictionary.


| Response Body

=== Get timeseries data

[cols="h,5a"]
|==============================================

| URL
| /api/v1/timeseries/[namespace]/[uid]/[field name]/

| Method
| GET

| Cookie
| csrftoken, sessionid

| Parameter(s)
|
from::
 An ISO8601 datetime, %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S for example 2015-04-01T13:14:15
to::
 An ISO8601 datetime.
timedelta_minutes::
 Mintes back in time (will default ‘from’ to now in time).
timedelta_hours::
 Hours back in time (will default ‘from’ to now in time).
timedelta_days::
 Days back in time (will default ‘from’ to now in time).
scale::
 Scale data by this factor. Default is 1 (no scaling)
operation::
 Performs simple mathematical operations on the data. Default is no operation. Possible operations
 are:

[width="75%", cols="1,4"]
!==============================================
!diff
! Perform the difference operation of the discrete time series data over N samples:

y[t] = (x[n+1] - x[n-1]) / [t(n+1) - t(n-1)].  (ie. approximately dy = dx / dt)

The resulting data series will have the unit of [unit / second] and is the approximative derivative of the input
sample (x[t]). Useful for getting the _rate of change_ of the measured data. The output will be of length N - 2.

!smooth_diff
! Experimental: Perform forward difference operation of the discrete data and
performs a moving average before and after the diff operation to obtain a smoothed variant for visual purposes only.

The resulting series will contain less than N samples over the interval.

!cum_sum
! Perform the cumulative sum operation:

y[n] = x[0] + x[1] ... + x[n]

The resulting series will be of length N.

=== Get time series data statistics
Use this service to get statistics and calculated metrics for your time series data.

The elements in the list called *daily_activity* are *day*, *values stored* and
*values in percent of most active day*.

The calendar structured is only returned if parameter *build_calendar* is set to True.
The calendar structure is made for visualizing a classic calendar, week by week.
It is returned as an hierarchical structured into year -> month -> week -> Day.
All weeks have 7 elements, but since the start and end of the first and last week may
lie in the previous or next month, those days are represented with *null* elements as
seen in the example output, ie. 2015-12-01 is a Tuesday, hence it place in that particular
week is the second element and the element with index 0 (Monday) before is simply null.

The data returned in the calendar structure is the same as the elements of the
list called *daily_activity*.

=== Time series anomaly detection
This service is *experimental* and is subject to change at any point without notice.

Returns a list of elements, each carrying a date and a distance to a calculated
typical segment. The distance figure is a number >= 0. Larger numbers are more
different. What this distance means is left for interpretation.

The time series under analysis is split into a number of segments. The algorithm
will then for each segment return a number defining how different each segment is
to a fictitious typical segment by some definition.

Algorithm behaviour can be adjusted by a number of parameters as described below.

The order of the returned data is either by distance to the typical or in date order.

_Note:_
This service makes all calculation on the fly and does not
depend on any pre-calculated data - hence it is not be performing optimal.
The parameters can be possibly altered to the point where the algorithm terminates, in
that case a code 504 (timeout) response will be returned. In case of malformed
parameters of data, a 500 response may be returned while this function is in
experimental mode.

== Byteport asynchronous APIs

=== Asynchronous protocols
Byteport also supports asynchronous communications, both for storing data and for sending messages to connected
devices, the protocols we support are:

* MQTT (port 1883)
* MQTT / SSL (port 8883)
* STOMP (port 61613)
* STOMP / SSL (port 61614)

The message broker is as of v0.7 (2016, Feb.) not open for public access. To access the broker you need a valid login
and the hostname of the broker to use. To obtain one you can contact *support@byteport.se*.

=== Storing data

==== Comma separated data
The messages posted should to the broker should be valid JSON and look like the example below. Note that even if
a single message is sent, it should still be wrapped in a JSON list item and this is highly suitable for bulk
loading data into Byteport.

....
[
  {
    "namespace": "theNamespace",
    "uid": "deviceUID",
    "timestamp": "1337666777.123",
    "data": "temp=10;last_word=mom;"
  },
  {
    "namespace": "theNamespace",
    "uid": "deviceUID",
    "timestamp": "1337666787.123",
    "data": "temp=10;last_word=\"i love you\";"
  }
]
....

The data-field could contain an arbitrary amount of data values.

=== Receiving data
The same broker can also be used to obtain messages from the Byteport IoT platform, typically for controlling devices
in real-time or altering device parameters etc.

All Byteport devices can listen on its designated queue, such as:

....
/queue/device_messages_NAMESPACE.DEVICEUID
....

The data sent to devices can *take on any form* as long as it is a valid ASCII string.


=== WebSocket API [Beta] ===
Experimental API that may not be active on the main servers as of this minute.

The URL format for the WebSocket API is

ws://[hostname]/ws/[service name]/


==== Subscribe for device control updates ====
By connecting and subscribing to the following URL

ws://[hostname]/ws/device/control/[Namespace name]/[Device UID]?subscribe-broadcast

You will receive instant updates to changes made to the Device Control data

Response example:
....
{
    'set_fields': {
        'name': 'switch1',
        'value': 'off'
    }
}
....
